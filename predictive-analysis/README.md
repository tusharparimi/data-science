The project consists of three parts. Each part of analysis will have some commonality as the we are only going to bet on Boston Red Sox win for every match. 
The probability that Boston Red Sox win at home is 0.59 and the probability that New York Yankees win at their home ground is 0.55.
We will receive $505 when Red Sox win a match, and we lose $525 when Red Sox do not win the match. 
It is to be noted that all the analysis will be based on best of n matches that means if itâ€™s a series of 3 matches 
then if one team wins the first two then the third match will not happen.

Performed following statistical analysis:

* Chi-square goodness-of-fit test
* Confidence interval estimate
* Probability distribution and computing expected net win.
